1) The room does not have a lock on it
2) Must feel relaxed and affectionate with rescue dogs
3) Please keep room tidy; throw out your trash and recycling daily
4) No use of condo kitchen ( studio has a kitchenette but the other airbnb room does not)
5)  Please strip bed and open windows at check out
6) Cannot store luggage pre-arrival or post check -out
7) No smoking anything/anywhere on the property or outside on the court: sorry. Rule is enforced as per the request of our neighbors. 

My son (now a young man) is also helpful with guests. My new dog, Callie,  is one of the sweetest mutts ever...She's a rescue and still a puppy so it's best if you like and understand dogs.

Notes & rules: 
1) The room does not have a lock on it
2) Must feel relaxed and affectionate with rescue dogs
3) Please keep room tidy; throw out your trash and recycling daily
4) No use of condo kitchen ( studio has a kitchenette but the other airbnb room does not)
5)  Please strip bed and open windows at check out
6) Cannot store luggage pre-arrival or post check -out
7) No smoking anything/anywhere on the property or outside on the court: sorry. Rule is enforced as per the request of our neighbors. 

My son (now a young man) is also helpful with guests. My new dog, Callie,  is one of the sweetest mutts ever...She's a rescue and still a puppy so it's best if you like and understand dogs.

Interests cover much from enjoyment of nature, environmental concerns, sports and many cultural venues.  Work entails landscape design and maintenance focusing on ecology as well human impacts on land. 

Painting mainly on fine porcelain, writing and photography, music and theatre satisfy artistic desires.   I prefer to travel to places to live as a temporary resident to learn about other people, places and customs.

I also enjoy interacting with people of different backgrounds and countries around the world.  It is one of the most satisfying learning experience.

If you're looking for a safe, comfortable place with fabulous amenities and Wi-Fi (we know you need the Wi-Fi!) in the Boston MA area, Washington DC, Miami FL or very close to NYC in Jersey City or Hoboken, we'd love to host you. Many of the buildings where our apartments are located feature amenities such as beautiful lobbies, 24 hour front desk staff, fitness centers, business centers, recreation rooms, indoor or outdoor pools and whirlpools. If you are traveling with children, some buildings offer playgrounds (many buildings are near public playgrounds as well) or indoor playrooms. Depending on the location, you can stay for just a few days, a week, a month or more. 

We offer an assortment of short-term apartments in sizes ranging from a studio to three bedrooms that are fully furnished with all the comforts of home. Our local staff meticulously prepares your apartment before your arrival, and we offer 24 hour assistance for any emergencies after business hours. When you arrive at your apartment, the beds will be made, towels and bath amenities will be stocked in the bathrooms, and the coffee maker will be set up in the kitchen with some sample coffees, sweetener and creamer (teabags too if that is your preference) to start your morning off properly. If you’d like to cook a meal, the kitchen is stocked with dishes, cutlery, glassware and pots and pans. The living room is set up with a TV and cable channels, and the Wi-Fi router password and instructions will be prominently displayed so you can get connected quickly. You can also make local and toll-free phone calls at no charge.

Self check-in/out will allow for social distancing here. 
As you can see in almost all of reviews from previous guests, we hold cleanliness to a high standard and clean apartment is our priority. 

To prevent the spread of the coronavirus (COVID-19), we have implemented a comprehensive cleaning and sanitizing protocol. This includes sanitizing tables, counters, door and cabinet knobs.

I’d like to also ask all guests to follow CDC and the Massachusetts Department of Health guidelines and recommended techniques and updates. 

Thank you so much for your understanding and cooperation.

I love to experience new places, new foods and meet new people.   Having lived in Brazil, Japan, Thailand and many years here in the United States I appreciate diverse viewpoints and customs.    Getting helpful insight from friendly locals makes any stay so much richer.

For my day job, I develop multifamily housing.   I am interested in creating living solutions that allow residents to pursue their passions and interests while having a smaller environmental footprint.    To that end, I am involved in a startup that uses architectural robotics to create transformable spaces.

As a father of five, I am a family man.   I appreciate the challenges and joys of travelling with family.    My wife and I took our children down the Silk Road on a 3 week hand carry only trip.

Just ","Central Square is truly the center of everything that's happening in Cambridge. Located right in between Harvard Square and Kendall Square (MIT), it's walking distance to both institutions and all the research centers in the area. I used to bike from Harvard to MIT when I was a student, a very pleasant 15 minute ride. Harvard Street is just two streets north of Massachusetts Avenue, which is the main street that connects these school and also directly leads to downtown. A simple Google search shows that there're more than twenty 4-Star+ coffee shops and countless 4-Star+ restaurants, you can walk to restaurants, coffee shops, grocery stores, universities, just about everywhere.",https://a0.muscache.com/pictures/miso/Hosting-46780054/original/2034f0e0-343a-432d-82fa-6b25222fc946.jpeg,45011296,https://www.airbnb.com/users/show/45011296,Lance,2015-09-24,"Cambridge, United Kingdom","A world traveler trapped inside a body of an entrepreneur who wants to make the world a better place to live. This career path gave me the freedom to control my time and hence I was able to travel internationally at least a few times a year, I've been to over 15 countries across four continents, the pace's just too slow. I love staying at Airbnb to get local tips, make new friends, and as a way for me to enrich my global experience without physically traveling there, I want to become a host as well. Boston is a tourist destination for many reasons, and in Cambridge, I meet many intelligent, fun, and creative people all around the world. I hope to be a host and local guide for those who visiting Cambridge and Boston.

We really enjoyed Costa Rica, Dominican Republic and Ecuador/Galapagos Islands. In our wild youth we both traveled through Asia. In addition we head to Sweden and Germany once a year to visit family and spend time in a remote summer cottage by the ocean.
