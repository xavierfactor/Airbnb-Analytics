I love hosting people from all over the world, and know the Cambridge/Boston area well for a native NY'er (I've been here since graduate school which was over 20 yrs ago). You will find the environment here 'on the court' restful, peaceful and as my current guest from Australia put it, ""I  figured you were a healer of some sort-- because your home feels healing."" Our place is relaxing and down to earth, with  an artistic and colorful ambiance, and lots of sunlight.

A few notes & rules to help you decide if this is a good landing spot!
1) Bedroom doors do not have a locks on them
2) Best if you feel relaxed and affectionate with rescue dogs: (She won't be here if you rent the entire condo)
3) Please keep tidy; throw out your trash and recycling—at least every other day
4) Condo kitchen: Available for use only if you rent the entire condo; studio room has a kitchenette but the other airbnb rooms do not
5)  Please strip bed and open windows at check out
6) Cannot store luggage pre-arrival or post check -out
7) No smoking anything/anywhere on the property or outside on the court: Rule is enforced as per the request of our neighbors. 
8) Please be vaccinated against covid and updated with booster for variants of the virus for your own and our protection; thank you ! 

My son (now a young man) is also helpful with guests. My new dog, Callie,  is one of the sweetest mutts ever...She's a rescue and still a puppy so it's best if you like and understand dogs. She will not be here if you are renting the entire condo, of course :) She's a gem and needs a little petting initially in order to settle down around new guests! She will definitely bark a tiny bit when you come & go. Small children live upstairs so at times you will hear them running around; they are adorable and sweet!

I love hosting people from all over the world, and know the Cambridge/Boston area well for a native NY'er (I've been here since graduate school which was over 20 yrs ago). You will find the environment here 'on the court' restful, peaceful and as my current guest from Australia put it, ""I  figured you were a healer of some sort-- because your home feels healing."" Our place is relaxing and down to earth, with  an artistic and colorful ambiance, and lots of sunlight.

A few notes & rules to help you decide if this is a good landing spot!
1) Bedroom doors do not have a locks on them
2) Best if you feel relaxed and affectionate with rescue dogs: (She won't be here if you rent the entire condo)
3) Please keep tidy; throw out your trash and recycling—at least every other day
4) Condo kitchen: Available for use only if you rent the entire condo; studio room has a kitchenette but the other airbnb rooms do not
5)  Please strip bed and open windows at check out
6) Cannot store luggage pre-arrival or post check -out
7) No smoking anything/anywhere on the property or outside on the court: Rule is enforced as per the request of our neighbors. 
8) Please be vaccinated against covid and updated with booster for variants of the virus for your own and our protection; thank you ! 

My son (now a young man) is also helpful with guests. My new dog, Callie,  is one of the sweetest mutts ever...She's a rescue and still a puppy so it's best if you like and understand dogs. She will not be here if you are renting the entire condo, of course :) She's a gem and needs a little petting initially in order to settle down around new guests! She will definitely bark a tiny bit when you come & go. Small children live upstairs so at times you will hear them running around; they are adorable and sweet!

A Few Facts About Me:

-I'm a professional performer.

-I have been to over 18 different countries and 3 continents.

-Six Characters in Search of An Author by Luigi Pirandello is my favorite play.

-My dad took me to see Phantom of the Opera when I was 8. He was afraid I’d find it boring. I gripped the seat in front of me the entire show and have since seen it 10 times. I think theater should be mandatory in schools.

- I love adrenaline sports like, Skydiving and Bungee Jumping.

-I was clearly born in the wrong time period. I prefer vintage clothes, classic TV, and I wish my name was Ella Fitzgerald.

-I love Indian food, and sushi, and southern food and… oh dear…

If you are traveling with children, some buildings offer playgrounds (many buildings are near public playgrounds as well) or indoor playrooms. Depending on the location, you can stay for just a few days, a week, a month or more. 

We offer an assortment of short-term apartments in sizes ranging from a studio to three bedrooms that are fully furnished with all the comforts of home. Our local staff meticulously prepares your apartment before your arrival, and we offer 24 hour assistance for any emergencies after business hours. When you arrive at your apartment, the beds will be made, towels and bath amenities will be stocked in the bathrooms, and the coffee maker will be set up in the kitchen with some sample coffees, sweetener and creamer (teabags too if that is your preference) to start your morning off properly. If you’d like to cook a meal, the kitchen is stocked with dishes, cutlery, glassware and pots and pans. The living room is set up with a TV and cable channels, and the Wi-Fi router password and instructions will be prominently displayed so you can get connected quickly.

This is a wonderful neighborhood and I really love sharing it with people.  It is good to remember the ocean is also near by and it is accessible by subway, rail or bus.  There are countless historical sites, museums, restaurants and shopping experiences in the area.

A few notes & rules to help you decide if this is a good landing spot!
1) Bedroom doors do not have a locks on them
2) Best if you feel relaxed and affectionate with rescue dogs: (She won't be here if you rent the entire condo)
3) Please keep tidy; throw out your trash and recycling—at least every other day
4) Condo kitchen: Available for use only if you rent the entire condo; studio room has a kitchenette but the other airbnb rooms do not
5)  Please strip bed and open windows at check out
6) Cannot store luggage pre-arrival or post check -out
7) No smoking anything/anywhere on the property or outside on the court: Rule is enforced as per the request of our neighbors. 
8) Please be vaccinated against covid and updated with booster for variants of the virus for your own and our protection; thank you ! 

My son (now a young man) is also helpful with guests. My new dog, Callie,  is one of the sweetest mutts ever...She's a rescue and still a puppy so it's best if you like and understand dogs. She will not be here if you are renting the entire condo, of course :) She's a gem and needs a little petting initially in order to settle down around new guests! She will definitely bark a tiny bit when you come & go. Small children live upstairs so at times you will hear them running around; they are adorable and sweet!

This career path gave me the freedom to control my time and hence I was able to travel internationally at least a few times a year, I've been to over 15 countries across four continents, the pace's just too slow. I love staying at Airbnb to get local tips, make new friends, and as a way for me to enrich my global experience without physically traveling there, I want to become a host as well. Boston is a tourist destination for many reasons, and in Cambridge, I meet many intelligent, fun, and creative people all around the world. I hope to be a host and local guide for those who visiting Cambridge and Boston.

My ideal vacation  has some of both. My favorite thing to do when traveling is see the unique natural and/or historic sites. I love hiking/walking, swimming, boating, etc. and don't mind a little adventure to get to a good spot! I also love trying new foods and doing a little local shopping.  For me, traveling is one of the most energizing and worthwhile things I can do. I most often travel with my siblings (I have 5!) or with my boyfriend. Girls trips are always fun too. I do less travel for work, but when I do I like to at least sneak in some ""local"" fun - like checking out a site or going to a nice restaurant.

We really enjoyed Costa Rica, Dominican Republic and Ecuador/Galapagos Islands. In our wild youth we both traveled through Asia. In addition we head to Sweden and Germany once a year to visit family and spend time in a remote summer cottage by the ocean.
