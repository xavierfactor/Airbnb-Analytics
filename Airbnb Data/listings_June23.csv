I love hosting people from all over the world, and know the Cambridge/Boston area well for a native NY'er (I've been here since graduate school which was over 20 yrs ago). You will find the environment here 'on the court' restful, peaceful and as my current guest from Australia put it, ""I  figured you were a healer of some sort-- because your home feels healing."" Our place is relaxing and down to earth, with  an artistic and colorful ambiance, and lots of sunlight.

A few notes & rules to help you decide if this is a good landing spot!
1) Bedroom doors do not have a locks on them
2) Best if you feel relaxed and affectionate with rescue dogs: (She won't be here if you rent the entire condo)
3) Please keep tidy; throw out your trash and recycling—at least every other day
4) Condo kitchen: Available for use only if you rent the entire condo; studio room has a kitchenette but the other airbnb rooms do not
5)  Please strip bed and open windows at check out
6) Cannot store luggage pre-arrival or post check -out
7) No smoking anything/anywhere on the property or outside on the court: Rule is enforced as per the request of our neighbors. 
8) Please be vaccinated against covid and updated with booster for variants of the virus for your own and our protection; thank you ! 

My son (now a young man) is also helpful with guests. My new dog, Callie,  is one of the sweetest mutts ever...She's a rescue and still a puppy so it's best if you like and understand dogs. She will not be here if you are renting the entire condo, of course :) She's a gem and needs a little petting initially in order to settle down around new guests! She will definitely bark a tiny bit when you come & go. Small children live upstairs so at times you will hear them running around; they are adorable and sweet!

I love hosting people from all over the world, and know the Cambridge/Boston area well for a native NY'er (I've been here since graduate school which was over 20 yrs ago). You will find the environment here 'on the court' restful, peaceful and as my current guest from Australia put it, ""I  figured you were a healer of some sort-- because your home feels healing."" Our place is relaxing and down to earth, with  an artistic and colorful ambiance, and lots of sunlight.

A few notes & rules to help you decide if this is a good landing spot!
1) Bedroom doors do not have a locks on them
2) Best if you feel relaxed and affectionate with rescue dogs: (She won't be here if you rent the entire condo)
3) Please keep tidy; throw out your trash and recycling—at least every other day
4) Condo kitchen: Available for use only if you rent the entire condo; studio room has a kitchenette but the other airbnb rooms do not
5)  Please strip bed and open windows at check out
6) Cannot store luggage pre-arrival or post check -out
7) No smoking anything/anywhere on the property or outside on the court: Rule is enforced as per the request of our neighbors. 
8) Please be vaccinated against covid and updated with booster for variants of the virus for your own and our protection; thank you ! 

My son (now a young man) is also helpful with guests. My new dog, Callie,  is one of the sweetest mutts ever...She's a rescue and still a puppy so it's best if you like and understand dogs. She will not be here if you are renting the entire condo, of course :) She's a gem and needs a little petting initially in order to settle down around new guests! She will definitely bark a tiny bit when you come & go. Small children live upstairs so at times you will hear them running around; they are adorable and sweet!

A few notes & rules to help you decide if this is a good landing spot!
1) Bedroom doors do not have a locks on them
2) Best if you feel relaxed and affectionate with rescue dogs: (She won't be here if you rent the entire condo)
3) Please keep tidy; throw out your trash and recycling—at least every other day
4) Condo kitchen: Available for use only if you rent the entire condo; studio room has a kitchenette but the other airbnb rooms do not
5)  Please strip bed and open windows at check out
6) Cannot store luggage pre-arrival or post check -out
7) No smoking anything/anywhere on the property or outside on the court: Rule is enforced as per the request of our neighbors. 
8) Please be vaccinated against covid and updated with booster for variants of the virus for your own and our protection; thank you !
